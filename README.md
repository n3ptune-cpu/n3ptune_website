# n3ptune_website
This is the website HTML and CSS I used when creating my website.
Keep in mind, I'm not really a web developer, so I have used ChatGPT to help me make this website.
Please forgive me for that :(

Anyways, the code is all here and you can use it as you wish, however do not make a direct copy since it's only designed for my website.
