# n3ptune_website
This is the website HTML and CSS I used when creating my website.
**Keep in mind, I'm not really a web developer, so I have used ChatGPT to help me make this website.**
__Please forgive me for that :(__

Anyways, the code is all here and you can use it as you wish, just don't make it extremely identical in case people think that the site is fake..
Feel free to base your website design on this, I don't really have a use for a website but I do have the domain for a lot of needs for services that I host
for me and my friends. This just makes it easier to find information about me and the links to stuff I provide I guess.

It's not really interesting I know, but here we are I guess.
